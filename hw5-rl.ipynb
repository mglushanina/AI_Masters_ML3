Both are off-policy algorithms that are current go-to algorithms for continuous control tasks.\n\n**Select one** of these two algorithms (TD3 or SAC) to implement. Both algorithms are extensions of basic [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) algorithm, and DDPG is kind of \"DQN with another neural net approximating greedy policy\", and all that differs is a set of stabilization tricks:\n* TD3 trains deterministic policy, while SAC uses *stochastic policy*. This means that for SAC you can solve exploration-exploitation trade-off by simple sampling from policy, while in TD3 you will have to add noise to your actions.\n* TD3 proposes to stabilize targets by adding a *clipped noise* to actions, which slightly prevents overestimation. In SAC, we formally switch to formalism of Maximum Entropy RL and add *entropy bonus* into our value function.\n\nAlso both algorithms utilize a *twin trick*: train two critics and use pessimistic targets by taking minimum from two proposals. Standard trick with target networks is also necessary. We will go through all these tricks step-by-step.\n\nSAC is probably less clumsy scheme than TD3, but requires a bit more code to implement.
